Pitch: 
Tired of loaning out your tools to a neighbor and losing them?

MVP: 
Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovels to power washers to tile saws.  Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have available and request to borrow.

Stretch: 
Add a map for loaners to set limits on how far they are willing to lend their tools out, and how far borrowers are willing to drive to borrow something.  Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that neighbors are good borrowers before you approve a request.
